# imaging-1d-data
My repo for research about techniques of classification of tabular and time series data through Convolutional Neural Networks

Article about this repo and experiments:
https://squaregraph.medium.com/time-series-imaging-9136d610660c

For now:

01. Notebook is an entry level experiment (Markov Transitition Field and Gramian Angular Field), with comparison to the RF, BOSSVS and Rocket algorithms.
02. Notebook is a Transfer Learning on the same dataset (Resnet101, Inception V3)
03. Link to the full trained model (Inception V3) https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wMqCyIfMFgCQ3h6IxL6rXMXJPaEjNzKR?usp=sharing, later will post it on tfhub.dev, but need to fit it bit better (now is 93% of accuracy on FordA dataset).
